# Animal Crossing Turnip Tip Calculator
A basic [calculator app](https://turniptipcalc.remaniac.net/) which lets you calculate the tips (or sales commissions) of selling the turnips at others' Animal Crossing islands. Let the stonk-ness begins!

Please keep in mind this is NOT a turnip price prediction site. If you are looking for that, there are some sites out there and I personally use [Turnip Prophet](https://turnipprophet.io/).

## Instructions
It is pretty straightforward! Just enter the **buy/sell prices** and **tip percentage** you would like to give, then click the **"Calculate"** button and the tip amount (as well as other informations) will be generated.

## Support
This app is still under development and will be improved over time.

If you come across any issues using the site, or would like to suggest something, feel free to slide me a DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/remaniac3) or drop me an [email](mailto:r3maniac@gmail.com).
